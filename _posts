Lets create a new blog post

Navigate to the _posts folder on GitHub
Click Add file > Create new file
Name your file 2022-08-27-your-new-blog-post.md
Set the title of your blog post by using a markdown header
Write this as the first line ## This is my first blog post
Add some content…write some random things, whatever you want
Throw in a code block (code blocks are created by surrounding your code snippet with three backticks at each end and an optional “language hint”), copy paste this in: Copy
 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
Important note, if you’re using T-SQL code, make sure to use the tsql tag. This will tell your site that you want to use the SSMS style formatting.
Click the Preview tab so you can see what it looks like so far.
